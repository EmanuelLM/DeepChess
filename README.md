# DeepChess
Neural Network architecture able to learn position evaluation from scratch. This project draws inspiration from the 2016 paper ["DeepChess: End-to-End Deep Neural Network
for Automatic Learning in Chess"](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/papers/deepchess.pdf).


This repository is part of the Deep Learning course given by Jian Tang at H.E.C Montr√©al
